== turing-emu ==

turing-emu is a simple emulator for turing machines. It provides facilities
for executing machines on tapes and for debugging machines.

The turing machines which turing-emu deals with have the following properties:

    - A state is either HALT or q<name>. The name of a non-halt state is an
        alphanumeric string.
    - A symbol is either a blank symbol or a Unicode character symbol.
    - Move instructions: left, neutral, and right.
    - Failing to find a matching instruction for the current state and
        current tape head symbol is a runtime error for the machine.

turing-emu takes two mandatory filename arguments: the INSTRUCTIONS file,
and the INPUT_TAPE file.

= Normal mode =

The default mode. Gets the final state and output tape of the machine,
and writes them to:

    - A file on disk.
        - Default filename is output_tape.txt.
        - Specify a filename with --output or -o
    - Or, standard output. Request this with --stdin or -s

By default, 10 symbols to the left of the tape head and 10 symbols to the
right of the tape head will be output. Specify different numbers with
--ldist (or -l) and --rdist (or -r)

= Interactive debug mode =

Debug mode is requested with --debug or -d. Most other options are not
compatible with debug mode.

In debug mode, the arrow keys are used for navigation.

    - Up arrow: step backwards in the computation.
    - Down arrow: step forwards in the computation.
    - Left arrow: scroll left through the tape.
    - Right arrow: scroll right through the tape.

= Runtime turing machine errors =

In normal mode, any error which the turing machine encounters during
its runtime is written along with the final state and the output tape.

In debug mode, any such error will be at the "bottom" stage of the computation.

= INSTRUCTIONS file format =

A file containing a number of instructions, each terminated with a semicolon.

Each instructions has five parts, separated by commas:
<initial state>, <initial symbol>, <new symbol>, <direction>, <new state>

A state is either HALT or a normal state. A normal state is written
q<name>, where name is a string of letters and/or numbers

A symbol is either b (for blank) or a character-symbol. A character-symbol
is written as a character literal enclosed in single quotes.

A direction is L (for left), N (for neutral/no-move), or R (for right).

= INSTRUCTIONS example =

q0,      b,  'a',  R, q1;
q1,     'x', 'y',  N, qhello;
qhello, 'h', '\n', R, HALT;

= INPUT_TAPE file format =

A file containing:
    a portion of the tape to the left of the head
    the tape head
    a portion of the tape to the right of the head
separated by semicolons.

The tape head is a single symbol, written as in an instructions file.

To the left and to the right of the tape head, we can specify however
many symbols we like, including no symbols. These lists of symbols
are comma-separated.

INPUT_TAPE is ordered left to right. All the symbols in the file form a
contiguous section of the tape. Beyond this section, in both directions,
is an infinite quantity of blank symbols.

= INPUT_TAPE examples =

'a', 'b', 'c' ; 'd' ; 'e', 'f', b
;b;

The last example is a completely blank tape.

= Command line examples =

turing-emu demo_inst.txt demo_input.txt -s
turing-emu instructions.txt input_tape_4.txt -o output_tape_4.txt -l 20 -r 20
turing-emu instructions.txt input_tape_6.txt -d
